Web-based Mapping Tool Focused for Vacant real estate in your city
---------------
Start putting vacant real estate in your city to good use by making it available for renting. The first step is to map all of the vacant city real estate. [Read more](/Otvorena-imovina.md) 

[Take a look at the web-based map community created at Oakland Data Day](https://github.com/map-communities/old-oakland-vacant-lots)

The CodeAcross 2014 resultant project can be found [here](http://zagreb.codeforcroatia.org/otvorene-karte/imovina-zagreb-2011.html) and the source can be viewed [here](https://github.com/openzagreb/otvorene-karte/).

Zagreb Officials Data (PopIt)
---------------
Delve deep in to contact data of officials in City of Zagreb to help make more educated decisions on city's needs. [Contribute](https://zagreb.popit.mysociety.org)

Zagreb Council Transcripts (SayIt)
---------------
Publish transcripts from meetings or share statements from those in power. Anyone can use SayIt, alone or in collaboration with others. SayIt uses PopIt as a elected officials database.

**For councils and organisations that hold public meetings**
Still publishing meeting transcripts on PDFs? SayIt makes it easier for your readers to find the parts that really interest them.

Unlike crusty old PDFs, SayIt works beautifully on every device from a phone to a tablet to a desktop. And itâ€™s acccessible for screenreaders and assistive devices. [Contribute](http://zagreb-skupstina.sayit.mysociety.org)

Zagreb Officials Contact Form (WriteIt)
---------------

As an extension of PopIt (API with officials data), you can setup own instance of WriteIt for sending emails directly to elected officials. [See Zagreb WriteIt instance here](http://grad-zagreb-hrvatska.writeit.ciudadanointeligente.org/en/)

Build with data what is available and @OpenZagreb will speak with city officials to keep permanent record on their web sites in XML form. Document if changes in XML structure are needed / recommended.

Open city maps
